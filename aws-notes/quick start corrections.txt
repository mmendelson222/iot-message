IOT quick start Documentation incorrect. 

Verify MQTT Subscribe and Publish
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/verify-pub-sub.html
The topic referred to in both Mosquitto commands should read "topics/test", not topic/test. 

Configure and Test Rules
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/config-and-test-rules.html
There's a terminology issue in the DynamoDB table.  
"The DynamoDB table must have a hash key of type String named "topic" and a range key of type String named "timestamp."
hash key = partition key
range key = sort key

So in the description it would be helpful to add something like, "set up a dynamodb table called sampleTable with a partition key field called "key" and a sort key field called "timestamp".
Also there is a correction to the JSON.  hashKeyField and hashKeyValue should read as follows:
"hashKeyField": "topic",
"hashKeyValue": "${topic()}",

Use the Device Registry and Device Shadows
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/registry-and-shadows.html
Under the Simulate a Device heading: 
When sending through Mosqitto, do NOT use enclose the topic in quotes.  So: 
..... -t '$aws/things/lightbulb1/shadow/update' .....  should be: 
..... -t $aws/things/lightbulb1/shadow/update .....  
I also found this on the AWS forums: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=682387&#682387


There is inconsistent terminology in the section which sets upa rule for insert message into dynamodb.  The instructions read:  "The DynamoDB table must have both a Partition key of type String and a sort key of type String configured".
You might want to make note of the fact that these are called Hash and Range fields in the rule definition json and interface.  

In the console, you can't delete a thing unless it is detached from its certificate.  If deletion fails, no error message is displayed.
